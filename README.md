yarn start OR npm start
```

## Overview
You were asked by a small company to build a mini CRM that's not quite as full-featured as the normal CRM because, let's be honest, they charge up the wazoo. Pretty much, all they need is a contact list that they can CRUD with.

## Feature list
Musts (Base goals):
- Create a contact (should be able to toggle whether it shows or not)
- Display all contacts
- Remove a contact

Would be nice (Stretch goals):
- Update a contact's details

## Each contact will have the following fields
\* = Required field
- First Name*
- Last Name*
- Company
- Email
- Phone
- Address
- Photo URL
